Google's AI Overview feature introduced in 2024 fundamentally changed how search results are displayed. This article provides a detailed explanation of the latest trends and strategies for 2025.

## What is AI Search (AIO)?

AI search (AIO) is Google's AI-powered search result summary feature. Unlike traditional search results, AI integrates information from multiple sources and provides direct answers.

### Differences from Traditional Search

- **Traditional**: Display a list of search results, users click to get information
- **AI Search**: AI integrates information and provides direct answers

## Changes in SEO Strategies in the AI Search Era

### 1. Declining Click-Through Rates

AI search has reduced opportunities for users to click on search results. Since AI provides direct answers, users no longer need to access sites.

**ReRank AI Analysis Data**:
- After AI search introduction, click-through rates from search results decreased by an average of 15-20%
- Particularly large impact on question-form searches like "How to" or "What is"
- Click-through rates decreased most for informational content (definitions, explanations, etc.)

**Solutions**:
- Create content that provides deeper information
- Include specific advice users can actually act on
- Create content based on unique perspectives and experiences

### 2. Information Integration

Since AI integrates information from multiple sources, it rarely depends on a single site.

**ReRank AI Analysis Data**:
- Average of 3-5 sites referenced in AI search
- Rarely only one site is referenced
- Integrates information from multiple sites to generate answers

**Solutions**:
- Create high-quality content that AI can easily reference
- Use structured data to make it easier for AI to understand
- Be recognized as a reliable information source

### 3. Importance of Content Quality

When AI integrates information, high-quality content is prioritized for reference.

**ReRank AI Analysis Data**:
- Characteristics of sites referenced in AI search:
  - High E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) (85%)
  - Structured data implemented (72%)
  - Long-form content providing comprehensive information (68%)

**Solutions**:
- Create content that strengthens E-E-A-T
- Implement structured data
- Provide comprehensive information in long-form content

## SEO Strategy Trends for 2025

### 1. Strengthening E-E-A-T

E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) has become more important than ever.

### 2. Structured Data Implementation

Implementing structured data makes it easier for AI to understand and reference your content.

### 3. Long-Form Comprehensive Content

Creating long-form content that comprehensively covers topics increases the likelihood of being referenced by AI.

## Solutions: Using ReRank AI

ReRank AI automatically detects ranking drops and proposes improvement suggestions based on competitor analysis.
