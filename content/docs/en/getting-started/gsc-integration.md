# GSC Integration

The main feature of ReRank AI is automatically monitoring rankings by integrating with Google Search Console (GSC).

## Integration Steps

1. Click "Add Site" on the dashboard
2. Select "Connect with Google Search Console"
3. Authenticate with your Google account (OAuth 2.0)
4. Select the site you want to monitor

That's all it takes to start automatic monitoring.

## Important Notes

- GSC integration requires Google account authentication
- You need access permissions to the GSC of the site you want to monitor
- It may take several hours after integration to retrieve the first ranking data

## Troubleshooting

### If Integration Errors Occur

- Check your Google account authentication status
- Clear browser cookies and try again
- Try a different browser

### If Sites Don't Appear

- Verify that the site is properly registered in GSC
- Confirm that site ownership verification is complete
